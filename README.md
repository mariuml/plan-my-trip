## Description

For the first project of the Front End Web Development Bootcamp [we](#team) were challenged to solve a real world problem. We decided on a travel app that would help make travel planning easier. Plan My Trip makes it easy for users to search for attractions in their chosen destination city using a readily available list. The app provides a forecast for the next 5 days so that users can plan according to the weather. It also remembers the last few searches so need to keep the browser open or open multiple tabs.
